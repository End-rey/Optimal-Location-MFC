# MFC Placement Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing facility placement in urban areas using data-driven analysis and visualization techniques.

## Overview

The repository contains code and resources for analyzing, formatting, visualizing, and optimizing facility placement within urban environments. The project is structured into several key folders:

### [main](/main)

The [main](/main) folder houses the final scripts that orchestrate the entire facility placement optimization process. This includes integrating data formatting, analysis, visualization, and any optimization algorithms to generate optimal facility placement recommendations.

### [research](/research)

Contains scripts and tools for conducting research on facility placement optimization. This could include data collection and analysis, optimization algorithms, and any other relevant research topics.

### [getting data](/getting_data/)

Contains scripts and tools for collecting and gathering relevant data for the facility placement analysis. This could include population demographics, transportation networks, existing facility locations, or any other data sources crucial for decision-making.
