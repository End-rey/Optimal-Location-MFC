# MFC Placement Optimization

This project focuses on optimizing facility placement in urban areas using data-driven analysis and visualization techniques.

## Overview

The repository contains code and resources for analyzing, formatting, visualizing, and optimizing facility placement within urban environments. The project is structured into several key folders:

### `centroid`

Contains scripts and tools for determining the centroids or optimal locations within each urban region. These centroids serve as potential candidates for facility placement.

### `data formatting`

This folder includes scripts and utilities for formatting and preprocessing the raw data required for analysis. It ensures that the data is in a suitable format for further processing.

### `visualization`

The `visualization` folder houses code for generating interactive maps to visualize the results of the facility placement analysis. These visualizations help in understanding the spatial distribution and impact of the chosen facility locations.

### `weighting`

In the `weighting` folder, you'll find notebooks for analyzing and experimenting with various weighting schemes. These techniques help in assigning importance or priority to different factors influencing facility placement decisions, such as population density or accessibility.

### `getting data`

Contains scripts and tools for collecting and gathering relevant data for the facility placement analysis. This could include population demographics, transportation networks, existing facility locations, or any other data sources crucial for decision-making.

### `main`

The `main` folder houses the final scripts that orchestrate the entire facility placement optimization process. This includes integrating data formatting, analysis, visualization, and any optimization algorithms to generate optimal facility placement recommendations.
